Testing The LogOut feature
---------------------------

The logout feature main function is to logout the user from the main page of the App and transfers him/her back to the login page, and in the process it gets rid of the user's token data -a security measure- and deletes the reference to the current user (sets the currrent user object back to null). so that a new user can login using the same App or to protect the security of the user's information.

To test that the logout function worked as intended -aside from obviously being logged out from the main page-,
we can observe the value of the currentuser object in three seperate instances throughout the run of the App, First before the user has logged in to the main page, the second time during the exceution of the program when the user is currently logged in -i.e: viewing his/her vizualized data-, and the third time after being logged out from the main page.

The Results ---> we notice that the currentuser object has "null" values for both the first and third instances, while in the second one, currentuser hold some specific values, (ex: ID, Token, ...etc) that are specific for each individual user. 

That tells us that the logout function has successfully removed the reference object of the current user by setting him to a null value.
